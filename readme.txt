# NepalispeechRecognitionTransformerCNN
ASR Nepali Transformer CNN ( Tensorflow , Keras )
DATASETS used:
The dataset used for training the NepaliSpeechRecognitionTransformerCNN models were collected from OpenSLR datasets (slr43 and slr54) with additional original datasets (i.e. Nep_DS_v1).

Trained MODELS:
There are three trained NepaliSpeechRecognitionTransformerCNN models inside the models folder that can be loaded using the inference code in the "DirectInferencingTRY(New Working).ipynb file".
If you want to train the model use the NepaliSpeechRecognitionCNN_Transformer.ipnyb file. 

MODEL Inference:
The inferencing code file may require installing some packages before import so do accordingly. I will add a requirement.txt file soon for all of the installation requirements. 

To run the model in GPU, use cudaToolkit version 11.2.2 and cudnn 8.1.0
